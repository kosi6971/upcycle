                                I was looking forward to take the classes which I can not take in my major. I was especially excited to take the 'Furniture Design' class since I am interested in design, but it turns out designing was really hard for me. Every class we had to go meet the professor with new ideas. That was the most thing I was looking forward but tough at the same time.

                                As it is a project with three majors, I was looking forward to finding out about other majors.

                                Working collaboratively with fellow majors was more common than I thought, but integrating with non-majors for a project was a first and carried high expectations.

                                I sure did. It was THE CHALLENGING time of my entire university life. There were so many things to do at the same time and it was hard for me to prioritize what to do. At first, I tried to do all the things and that was impossible. We all had to do it together but that didn't went well too. To be honest, I had a trouble with someone through the project. I had to control not to get angry all the time but I totally failed. Now because of this experience, I am kinda worried of my future since I could meet a colleague just like that someone.

                                Since it was a team work that everyone did together, there were conflicts because of different opinions. And each other's schedules were different, it was difficult to adjust the time. Still, the project was completed thanks to the consideration of the team members.

                                Initially, communication was the most challenging aspect. Differences in gender and majors made it difficult to communicate, but over time and as the project progressed, things naturally fell into place.

                                Every single thing was challenging but I think there was a time when we had a little joy with us. It was the moment when we were making our furniture. Since we had time just ourselves, we had a lot of conversations during that time. We laughed a lot and quite enjoyed a lot. Well..maybe just me.

                                Of course, it was when the furniture was completed. After months of hard work, the furniture was completed, so I felt proud and happy thinking, "It's finally over!"

                                At first, 'furniture design' required the most effort from me. Every class we had to come out with new ideas and organize it. So every class I had a little headache and I was exhausted after the class. But after the mid exam, 'webpage creating' required the most effort from me. We had to desigm, write sentences, make every single thing without professor's feedback. In the class we didn't learned the structure of the webpage. Instead, we learned the codes. Maybe that is why it was hard for me.

                                Absolutely furniture part. It was my major and I was the only one in the furniture department among the team members, so it was the hardest to lead the team members. There were a lot of things to do and to pay attention to.

                                No matter what others say, it's all about web page development. Given my weak design skills, I had to make many adjustments or deletions regardless of what I created.

                                PLEASE do not do this project. I don't think it's good for your mental health and everything. If you really want to do it, make webpage earlier. You struggled because you have started too late. But the best choice is not to do it. Just don't. And please ask professor to change your team member.

                                Never. Even if professor asks me to do it, never. It was such a hard time for me. I do not want to suffer again. I spent the most busy time in my life.

                                Nope. But, I recommend it to other friends. I made a lot of unforgettable memories maybe.

                                Yes, I would do it again. Since it was my first team project, there were many regrets. If given another chance, I am confident I could produce better results than now.

                                I felt like I had too much inefficient time. I can finish it in 2 months, but I didn't have a set time, so I used up my semester.

                                Like I said before, I started to make webpage too late. I thought there was a lot of time left but turns out it wasn't. I should never think like that. I should change myself.

                                Webpage. I regret starting the design too late, and I think the efficiency was reduced because the division of team members' tasks was not good.

                                Web design was the most regrettable aspect. While I've done a lot of seeing and creating, designing and building from scratch was new to me, and there were many shortcomings.

                                I think I learned giving feedbacks to others. I didn't know how to and what to give for the feedbacks before. But now I can give feedbacks to others. I think I improved this semester a lot. I am actually happy for that. And I met good friends. Not everyone was good but most of the colleagues in this project were very nice people. I hope to be friends even this project ends. Such a nice people.

                                I think it was a patience. When I getting stressful with this projects, I learned to persevere and listen to their stories and coordinate their opinions rather than angry about it.

                                Projects aren't something you can do well alone. You need to communicate more with your team members and engage analytically.

                                Definately no. You can never rest. This is such a big project so before someone do this project, I hope they do their best. I really mean by that. It is really important to do your best.
